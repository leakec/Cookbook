title: Carolyn's Crunch Wraps (Crunch Wrap Supreme)
chef: Carolyn Pittsburg Beauty Barn
ingredients:
    - name: Tortillas
      amount: 8
      notes: The largest tortillas you can find. Look for burrito tortillas.
    - name: Tostada shells
      amount: 8
    - name: Plant-based ground beef
      amount: 1
      units: pound
      notes: We really like the Beyond Beef brand. You could substitue real ground beef to make it non-vegetarian, but I honestly like it better with the plant-based version.
    - name: Lettuce
      amount: 1 cup?
    - name: Diced tomato and green chilies
      amount: 1
      units: can
      notes: Either use this or the tomato below. Do not use both. I prefer to use this and mix it in with the meat.
    - name: Tomato, diced
      amount: 1
      units: cup
      notes: Rather than using a tomato here, you can instead add a can of diced tomatos plus green chiles. I like this better than using the tomato.
    - name: Onion, diced
      amount: 1/2
      units: cup
    - name: sour cream
      notes: To taste.
    - name: Tostidos queso dip
      amount: 1
      units: jar
    - name: Tostidos medium salsa
      amount: 1
      units: jar
    - name: Taco seasoning
      amount: 1
      units: packet
    - name: Fresh cilantro
      notes: To taste.

time:
    prep:
        hh: 0
        mm: 5
    cook:
        hh: 0
        mm: 20

steps:
    - Heat up the meat. Mix in the tomatoes and taco seasoning while heating.
    - While your meat is getting real meaty, prep the veggies.
    - "Once the meat is cooked, heat a frying pan on medium/low and add some olive oil. Assemble the wrap as follows:"
    - Lay out your tortilla.
    - Add two tablespoons of queso dip in the center, about the size of one of the tostada shells. Everything will now go atop this circle of cheese.
    - Add a layer of meat.
    - Add your tostada.
    - Add a layer of sour cream if desired.
    - Add your veggies and salsa (1 tablespoon of salsa).
    - Gently fold the edge of your tortilla toward the center of the mound you have created, starting in one spot and owkring in a circle. Each new fold slightly overlaps the previous. The final product will be a hexagon (the bestagon). Place this folded side down and heat until golden brown. Flip and do the same on the other side.
