    - Dice up the onion and the garlic.
    - Remove the sausage from the casing and crumble into a pan.
    - Simultaneously, start cooking the pasta. Add a bit of salt to the pasta water.
    - Once the sausage has cooked a bit, add the onion and the garlic.
    - Once the onion has softened and the sausage is browned, add the kale and cook until it wilts.
    - Add red peper to taste (I like mine spicy).
    - Stop cooking the pasta one minute before it is done.
    - Add the pasta to the dish.
    - Create a light sauce with the cheese and pasta water.
    - Serve with extra parmesean on top.
