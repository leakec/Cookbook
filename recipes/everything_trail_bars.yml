steps:
    - "Highly recommend just raiding your pantry and adding whatever sounds right in roughly these proportions."
    - "Also double this recipe in the same size pan for a fluffier chewy bar!"
    - "Toffee Variant: add freeze dried fruit and honey instead of brown sugar."
    - In a large bowl, mix the chopped nuts, dried fruits, coconut, flour, oats, and cinnamon. See note above about doubling or placing in smaller baking tray to make fluffier bars.
    - In a separate bowl, mix the melted butter and brown sugar. Next, mix in the vanilla extract, salt, and baking soda. Lastly, whisk in the egg until everything is creamy.
    - Add the wet mixture to the nuts and fruit and mix well.
    - Cover the bowl and chill the dough in the fridge for at least 2 hours.
    - After the dough has chilled, preheat the oven to 350Â°F.
    - Press the dough into a metal 9x9 inch pan lined with parchment paper.
    - Bake for 15-18 minutes until the bars are golden brown and the smell fills your kitchen. Wait for the pan to completely cool before cutting into bars.
