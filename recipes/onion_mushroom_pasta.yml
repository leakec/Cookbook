    - Simultaneously, start frying the onion in a pan with olive oil.
    - Once the onions cook a bit, add in the portabelo mushrooms.
    - Add salt and red pepper to taste.
    - You may need to add water from the pasta to the onion/mushroom mix to keep it from drying out.
    - Pull out the pasta one minute before it is done.
    - For the last minute, cook the pasta with the onion/mushroom mix.
    - Add pecarino on top to taste.
