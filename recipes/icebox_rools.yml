steps:
  - Scald the two cups of milk in the microwave. Should take ~2 minutes on high.
  - Add 3 tablespoons of butter, 2 teaspoons of salt, and 1/2 cup sugar to the mixture. Stir until lukewarn. Ellen puts it in the fridge to cool faster.
  - While the above mixutre is cooling, prepare the yeast according to the package.
  - Combine the milk mixture, yeast, and 2 beaten eggs together.
  - Add in the flour. Start with 4 cups and then keep adding it until it doesn't take anymore (another 3-4 cups). "Doesn't take anymore" means that the flour stops folding into the mixture, i.e., you can still see it on top of the dough rather than it being consumed by the dough. The dough will flow up the bread hook if using a machine. When Ellen did it, she had to do the last bit by hand, and just kept adding more flour to the dough while kneeding until it didn't take anymore.
  - Put the dough into a greased bowl. If doing this the day before, then you can put it in the fridge to rise slowly overnight. Alternatively, you can let it rise at room temperature for ~2.5 hours. 
  - About 1.5 hours before baking, shape into rolls and place on a baking sheet. The cut rolls are about 1.5 inches high. Avoid twisting or pinching the dough as much as possible, as they will rise better. Let rise ~1.5 hours. Note, the original recipe calls for this to be done 2 hours before, but the time I watched Ellen make them, it was ~1.5 hours.
  - Bake at 350 for 20 minutes.
  - Brush the tops with butter.
