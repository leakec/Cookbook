steps:
  - Poke holes into potatoes with a fork.
  - Bake potatoes in the oven at 400 degrees F for 1 hour. Let cool.
  - Cut potatoes in half and scoop out the insides. Discard skins.
  - Mash the potatoes well with a fork.
  - In a large bowl, combine the potatoes, flour, eggs, salt, and a little pepper until a dough forms.
  - Put dough on a lightly flowered surface and knead until smooth. This should take about 3 minutes.
  - Divide dough into 4 pieces. Using your hands, roll each piece into a long rope, about 0.75 inches in diameter. 
  - Cut the ropes into 1 inch pices. Place the pieces on a lightly floured baking sheet. If the dough is too soft to work with, place it in the freezer for 10 minutes to chill.
  - Roll the pieces with the back side of a fork to create ridges and place back on the baking sheet.
  - In a pot, boil salted water and cook gnocchi until it floats to the top. This should take about 2 minutes. Reserve 0.5 cup of the pasta water, then drain.
  - Meanwhile, in a large skillet, melt the butter. Using a slotted spoon, add the gnocchi into the melted butter and season to taste with black pepper. Add the parmesean and pecorino, and toss until melted. 
  - Add the pasta water a few tablespoons at a time as needed to help the sauce come together.
  - Serve and enjoy :)
